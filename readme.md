### How to Contribute:

We started this series by a focus on Frontend, for example `FE resources in the first book` has some general resources for every field and also covers especial topics in FE, so it means there is room to grow this project to cover other fields such as Backend, DevOps, etc.

Therefore we will welcome your contribution even if your expertise lies outside of Frontend. If you know valuable resources in other fieldsâ€”such as Backend development (Java, Python, Rust, etc.)â€”weâ€™d love to include them in our [series](other-topics.md) for later to be added in the RFC. 

Our goal is to expand this project to cover all fields, creating a comprehensive guide for everyone and every useful topics that can benefit humanity.
